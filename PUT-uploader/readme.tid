PUT uploader module for the File Uploads plugin. Saves to ~WebDav or other servers accepting PUT requests.

Currently the uploader derives the base URL for the ~WebDav server from the URL of the document. This fits the use case of using a ~WebDav (or other PUT enabled server) used to host a ~TiddlyWiki that can be saved.

For a lightweight and easy solution for hosting a local ~TiddlyWiki using ~WebDav see this [[discussion|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/use-webdav-for-saving-a-single-file-wiki/441]].
